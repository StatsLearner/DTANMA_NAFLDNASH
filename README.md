# Network meta-analysis for DTA

## Overview
This repository contains a minimal set of R codes to reproduce our analyses shown in the paper:


## Contents
This repository includes:
- Stan codes for the separate MA model, the main NMA model, the simpler model, and the inconsistency model for NMA,
- R codes to fit those models with particular options and values for the function arguments,
- the raw data we used which includes study characteristics,
- the data that only includes information needed to run the codes above with a flag of inclusion for MA and NMA, and
- a set of `renv` files to be used to restore the package environment.
